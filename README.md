# NightscoutJr
Pebble watchface for Nightscout to suit young users

Still to do:
- Implement user settings (URL, units, low and high thresholds) in Pebble phone app
- Implement mg units (round down to lower 10, smaller font, BGMin = 50)
- Detection and support for monochrome (Aplite)
- Optimised polling (find 10s after update), currently polls once per minute regardless
- Training mode (show different random values between BGMin and BGMax when up button is pressed, revert to live readings after 10s)
- General code tidying and housekeeping
